So here is the breakdown of my vision for this project okay? I want the client to be able to take a look at the capabilities of my website (project) and its automation capabilities and then sign up on my beautiful sleek futuristic website like what (https://reflect.app/home) and (https://www.adaline.ai/) look like. Then, the customer dashboard should look like (https://openai.com/) where they can interact with a GUI in which they can list the websites to which they want to automate data entry/filling using my LAM. And then they should be able to see the playwright browser spool up in the custom vm session hosted on Runway (in my backend) and they should be able to see my LAM backend identify the correct parts to be filled in or selected or check marks to be ticked and more and fill it all in based on the plaintext data provided by the user in the form of CSV or PDF or DOC or TXT or MD.
