# Railway Deployment Fix Guide

## 🔧 Issue Resolution

The deployment error was caused by incorrectly including `subprocess` and `asyncio` as pip dependencies. These are built-in Python modules and should not be in `requirements.txt`.

## ✅ Fixed Files

1. **requirements.txt** - Removed problematic built-in modules
2. **railway.toml** - Updated for hybrid Python/Node.js deployment
3. **package.json** - Added for Node.js dependencies (Eko framework)
4. **nixpacks.toml** - Configured for proper build process
5. **start.sh** - Created startup script for proper initialization

## 🚀 Deploy Now

1. **Commit these changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment - remove built-in modules from requirements"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Redeploy on Railway:**
   - Go to your Railway dashboard
   - Click "Deploy" again
   - The build should now succeed

## 📋 What's Fixed

- ❌ **Before:** `subprocess` and `asyncio` in requirements.txt (causes error)
- ✅ **After:** Only external packages in requirements.txt
- ✅ **Added:** Proper Node.js dependencies for Eko framework
- ✅ **Added:** Hybrid Python/Node.js deployment configuration
- ✅ **Added:** Automated browser installation for Playwright

## 🔍 Build Process Now

1. **Setup:** Install Node.js 18 and Python 3.11
2. **Install:** npm packages (Eko) and pip packages (FastAPI, etc.)
3. **Build:** Install Playwright browsers and set permissions
4. **Start:** Run start.sh script which initializes everything

## 🎯 Expected Success

After this fix, your Railway deployment should:
- ✅ Build successfully without pip errors
- ✅ Install Eko framework via npm
- ✅ Install Playwright browsers
- ✅ Start FastAPI server on port 8000
- ✅ Support enhanced multi-browser automation

## 🆘 If Still Having Issues

Check Railway logs for:
- Node.js installation success
- npm install success
- Python package installation success
- Server startup confirmation
