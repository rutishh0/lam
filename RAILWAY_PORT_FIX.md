# ✅ Railway PORT Environment Variable Fix

## 🔧 **Issue Resolved**

The Railway deployment was failing with the error:
```
Error: Invalid value for '--port': '$PORT' is not a valid integer.
```

This happened because the `$PORT` environment variable wasn't being properly expanded in the uvicorn command.

## 🛠️ **Root Cause**

**Problem:** Railway's environment variable expansion wasn't working with the command:
```bash
python -m uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

The uvicorn process was receiving the literal string `'$PORT'` instead of the actual port number.

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Created Startup Script** (`backend/start.sh`)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Get the port from environment variable or default to 8000
PORT=${PORT:-8000}

echo "🚀 Starting server on port $PORT"

# Start the server
uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

### **2. Updated Railway Configuration**

**`backend/railway.toml`:**
```toml
[deploy]
startCommand = "bash start.sh"
```

**`railway.toml`:**
```toml
[deploy] 
startCommand = "cd backend && bash start.sh"
```

## 🎯 **How the Fix Works**

### **Before (❌ Failed):**
```
Railway → uvicorn server:app --port '$PORT' → Error: '$PORT' is not a valid integer
```

### **After (✅ Working):**
```
Railway → bash start.sh → PORT=8000 → uvicorn server:app --port 8000 → Success!
```

## 🚀 **Deployment Benefits**

✅ **Reliable Port Handling** - Proper environment variable expansion  
✅ **Default Port Fallback** - Uses port 8000 if PORT not set  
✅ **Clear Logging** - Shows which port the server starts on  
✅ **Cross-Platform** - Works on both Railway (Linux) and local development  

## 📋 **Files Modified**

1. **`backend/start.sh`** - New startup script (created)
2. **`backend/railway.toml`** - Updated startCommand
3. **`railway.toml`** - Updated startCommand

## 🔍 **Verification**

After pushing these changes, Railway should now:

1. ✅ Execute the bash script successfully
2. ✅ Properly expand the PORT environment variable
3. ✅ Start uvicorn on the correct port (usually 8000 or Railway's assigned port)
4. ✅ Deploy without PORT-related errors

## 🆘 **If Still Having Issues**

Check Railway deployment logs for:
- ✅ Script execution: `🚀 Starting server on port XXXX`
- ✅ Uvicorn startup: `Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:XXXX`
- ❌ Any bash script errors

## 🎉 **Status: Fixed**

Your Railway deployment should now start successfully without PORT environment variable issues! 🚀
